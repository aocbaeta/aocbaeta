- 👋 Hi, I’m @aocbaeta
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, advanced physics, and exploring the potential of AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and Python, as well as enhancing my skills in Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mobile development and data analysis projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via my profile or email at aocbaeta@gmail.com.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m passionate about applying second quantization techniques in software.

- Projects:
I developed a program to calculate propagators as part of a scientific initiation project during my undergraduate physics course. The program handles commutators and anticommutators through an algebraic commutator expansion, using Kronecker deltas to calculate summations within the propagator framework. Initially developed in Wolfram Mathematica, the project was later "translated" into Python, Rust, and Dart for use in a Flutter app.
